Monitor Environment Agency river level data and send email alerts

Idea
====

The Environment Agency publishes data on river levels, flood warnings
etc. via a web-accessible API.  We use this data to send alerts,
e.g. via email.  This is useful if, for example, for someone with a
boat which needs its mooring lines adjusted according to the level of
the river.
